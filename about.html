                <h2>Hello, and welcome!</h2>
                <p>My name is Evgeniia, and I am passionate about creating handmade crafts, jewelry, and decorative
                    items using a variety of materials. This page is dedicated to my journey, hobbies, and the projects
                    that bring me joy.</p>

            <div class="my-story">
                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>My journey began in childhood when I discovered a love for crafting. I attended various workshops and
                    clubs, exploring a wide range of techniques and materials. Over time, this passion blossomed into a
                    creative outlet that led me to focus on crocheting, knitting, and beadwork. While I haven’t ventured
                    into selling my creations yet, my friends and family are often the happy recipients of my handmade
                    gifts.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><em>Crocheting:</em></strong>
                        Crocheting is one of my favorite hobbies, allowing me to create both intricate large-scale
                        projects and charming smaller items. From cozy sweaters and stunning blankets to adorable toys,
                        crocheting offers endless possibilities for self-expression and creativity. Each piece tells its
                        own story, made with love and attention to detail.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Beadwork:</em></strong>
                        Beadwork is where my creativity truly shines. I design delicate handbags, elegant necklaces, and
                        lifelike flowers using intricate beading techniques. This hobby lets me combine color, texture,
                        and pattern into unique pieces that bring joy to both the maker and the wearer.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Holiday Crafts:</em></strong>
                        Crafting for holidays is my way of spreading festive cheer. Whether it's Christmas, Halloween,
                        Easter, or Valentine's Day, I love creating themed decorations, ornaments, and gifts. Each
                        project celebrates the spirit of the occasion, from sparkly Christmas ornaments to spooky
                        Halloween accents and heartfelt Valentine’s cards.</li>
                </ul>
